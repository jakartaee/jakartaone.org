      <p>
        I am a Java EE and Jakarta EE developer since 2005, rescuing "dead
        horse projects" especially when it is widely accepted that it is not
        possible. Do you know that relief when you reduce complexity? Do you
        know that happiness of all those side effects which were not expected
        at all? I mean ... not those bad side effects, zombies attacking from
        your suite case - I mean positive side effects. You just wanted to
        understand the code, so you changed formatting, renamed variables,
        methods, reduced their visibility, understood the API, started moving
        things ... and when you understood, somehow it worked with a better
        performance. Something broke? Easier to fix than to fix a typo before
        your changes. You even have fun of writing tests, huh! Found bug is a
        good bug. Are you happy? I am!
