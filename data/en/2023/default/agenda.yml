        Developers are just common people, lazy and scared of changes. But they
        are also selfish and they have passion and desire to be happy.
        Sometimes they go crazy and do something they were told that it is not
        possible. Refactor and modernize an unmaintainable project. How?

        Did you know you can containerize your Jakarta EE, MicroProfile and
        Spring Boot applications to start up in milliseconds, without
        compromising on throughput, memory, development-production parity, or
        Java language features?  InstantOn with org.crac support enables rapid
        startup for native cloud apps.

        Loom brings virtual threads. You can have million of them: they are
        cheap to create and cheap to block. Consequence? Forget about your
        old asynchronous, callback based code. Improve your performances with
        simple, imperative, mono-thread, blocking code!

        Upgrading to Jakarta EE 10 brings some challenges - renaming packages
        from javax to jakarta and dealing with removed APIs. I'll show you how
        to seamlessly upgrade apps to Jakarta EE 10 in a very short time,
        automating transformation of the source code and dealing with
        application dependencies.

        This session aims to crystalize why open standards like Jakarta EE are
        critically important to you today and in the future. We will explore
