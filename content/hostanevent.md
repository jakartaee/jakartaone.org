<h2>JakartaOne Language Host Process </h2>

</br>
<p>
The Jakarta EE Working Group’s goal is to organize one JakartaOne Livestream per year and
grow the Language Specific JakartaOne Livestream event series in different languages.
</p>

<p>
JakartaOne Livestream is a virtual conference proven to be a great way to reach out to the vast
Java developer community. By the end of 2020, in addition to the principal JakartaOne
Livestream with its audience of nearly 2,000 expected attendees, three Language Specific
JakartaOne Livestreams will be hosted, with an expected total audience of nearly 1,000
developers across the globe, listening in Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil) & Spanish.
</p>

<p>
These Language Specific events are organized by the community and serve as a great way for
individuals to build their network and presence in the community while benefiting from the
Jakarta EE brand and the tested hosting process.
</p>

<p>
Community members interested in organizing their own language specific Language Specific
JakartaOne Livestream events should create a <a href="https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaone.jakarta.ee/issues/new?template=jakartaone_livestream.md">GitHub issue</a> and fill in the required information.
Next, send an email to <a href="mailto:events@jakarta.ee ">events@jakarta.ee</a> with the names of individuals on the proposed
Program Committee and their email address.
</p>

<p>
The Eclipse Foundation team will reach out for the next steps. Once a GitHub issue is
submitted, the approval of the Jakarta EE Marketing Committee and the Steering Committee is
needed in order to proceed with the event.
</p>

<p>
JakartaOne events are funded via the Jakarta EE Working Group budget. Organization of the
event needs to be raised during the Marketing and Steering Committee calls. Anyone from
these Jakarta EE Working Group Committees are welcome to get involved in driving the event
along with the Eclipse Foundation staff. The event will be considered approved when there is an
agreement from the Jakarta EE Working Group’s Marketing and Steering Group Committees
and Eclipse Foundation staff involved in the work of the Jakarta EE Working Group.
</p>

<p>
The approval will be noted in the GitHub issue. If the application is approved, the Eclipse
Foundation will provide the framework and guidance for organizing the event including:
</p>


<ul>
<li>A specific folder in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/11nvqdVqFlCxm5AfPh2NdnanTBrCPW8Xv">Community Folder</a> so the progress is transparent for everyone.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Social media script examples to be translated by the program committee</li>
  <li>Policies for speakers, hosting & marketing the event</li>
</ul>
<li>Access to an account to be used for CFP - papercall.io</li>
<li>Platform to be used for the conference - crowdcast.io</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Creation of the crowdcast event</li>
  </ul>
<li>Creation of a regional twitter handle to be managed by the program committee</li>
<li>Creation of the event website on https://jakartaone.jakarta.ee/ to be updated and managed by
the program committee</li>
<li>Regular assistance with the hosting process including bi-weekly meetings with the
Eclipse team and training on using the complete process.</li>
</ul>


<p>The event needs to remain vendor-neutral and should have the following main categories on the
program:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Keynotes</li>
    <li>Vendor / Industry brief keynotes highlighting Jakarta EE compatible products</li>
    <li>Jakarta EE & MicroProfile related technical sessions</li>
</ul>

</br>

<p>
The process to host a Regional JakartaOne Livestream should begin no later than 16 weeks
prior to the planned hosting date. Below is a broad timeline of the event process:
